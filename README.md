#   This is a basic program that renames all files with a new name ending an increasing number starting from 1   #

This is an free script built by me to ease my work whenever I need to rename a huge number of files.
You are allowed to use this script for free, distribute it or make it even better.


# To use
- Install Python from https://www.python.org/ or any IDE such as pycharm, https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.
- Input the full path of the folder when being prompted.
- Make sure the file names are of equal length so that they can be sorted in ascending order (sorted in lexicographical order.
- If there are filenames that are not of equal length, you can select the fixed option which will add "0"s to the start of the filenames until they are equal to the length of the longest filename.
- When renaming files, only a newname will be given while the rest of the files will have the same new name but an integer at the back start from 1, 2, 3 and so on.

# Additional things to notice
- There are two versions: Command Line Interface(CLI), and Graphical User Interface(GUI).
- For CLI, access the CLI version folder and only Python 3 is needed.
- For GUI, access the GUI version folder. You are required to download PyQt5 using *pip install PyQt5-stubs*
- The main file for GUI version is renamingScriptGUI.py. Using python to run that file.
